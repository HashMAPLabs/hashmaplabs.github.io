		<h1>Our Philosophy</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Programming is a form of skill which each and everyone ought to learn. Programming languages, on the other hand, are just tools which are used to showcase these skills. One should always strive to learn the concepts of programming and develop them as a skill rather than falling prey to its rhetorics. We are here to impart these very skills using the three core fundamentals on which Computers are built: <strong>Mathematics</strong>, <strong>Algorithms</strong> and <strong>Programming</strong>. Once equipped with these skills, anyone can pick up a programming language in a matter of days. So let it be Python, Java or Rust, as long as you have these concepts imbibed in you, learning them would be child's play.

				<p>Computers were built on the principles of Mathematics. The principles of addition, subtraction, etc being abstracted into 0's and 1's, while combinatorics, probability, etc used for Machine Learning algorithms, the requirement for the knowledge of mathematics hasn't been higher. Before learning the art of programming, one has to strengthen their mathematical concepts. Keeping this in mind, we will provide you with the necessary resources to fine-tune your problematical skills to go in line with your programming skills.</p>

				<p>Algorithms are fundamentally the most important component of a computer/system/machine. Anyone can be judged based on their knack for writing algorithms. But surprisingly, algorithms are one of the simplest techniques that one can learn. We will help you learn these skills through interactive and intuitive visuals.</p>

				<p>Programming is the skill of communicating with machines in a clear way. Much like human communication, unless the machines are given the exact instructions, they will fail in providing the necessary outputs. The nuances of techniques might be overwhelming but we are here to simplify this and help you master the required skills.</p>
